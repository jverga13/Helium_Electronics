## Smaller SPIne Communication Board (Cost-Reduced Version)

This directory contains the design files for a modified, cost-reduced version of the main SPIne Communication Board.

### Key Modifications
The primary goal of this version is to lower costs and simplify in-house manufacturing.

- **Reduced Size:** The PCB dimensions have been significantly decreased to lower the cost of fabrication.
- **Simplified Assembly:** Uses solder pads for connections instead of full components where possible.

### Original Board Overview

This board is based on the main **SPIne Communication Board**, which acts as the central nervous system for the robot. It processes high-level commands from a host computer (like a Jetson Nano) and manages real-time communication with the motors via CAN bus. It's designed to work with a secondary Connector Board that distributes power and signals.

The core features of the original design include:
- **Dual STM32F446 Microcontrollers** for real-time processing.
- **A 40-pin header** to stack directly onto a host computer.
- **Four independent and galvanically isolated CAN bus channels** for robust motor communication.
- **Onboard power regulation** and isolated DC-DC converters.
