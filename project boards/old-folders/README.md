# [ARCHIVED] - Old and Deprecated Designs

**❗ Important Notice ❗**

This directory contains a collection of old, experimental, and deprecated design files. The contents of this folder are **not for current use**.

---

## Purpose of this Directory

The designs in this folder are kept for a few key reasons:

* **Historical Record:** They show the evolution and progression of our design process.
* **Reference:** There may be specific ideas, component footprints, or routing techniques in these old files that could be useful for reference in future projects.
* **Learning:** They serve as a record of what worked and, more importantly, what didn't.

Please **do not** use any of the projects in this directory as a starting point for new work. They may be incomplete, contain errors, or use outdated components.

For all active and current projects, please refer to the main project directories.
