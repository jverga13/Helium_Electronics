This is the Repo where all the libraries and PBC Projects are accumulated.

The paper on which we are basing the majority of the electronics system is available here.

The primary difference between the MIT Paper and our project is that we will be utilizing a camera and LiDAR for navigation, and we are employing "smarter" motors with their built-in motor controllers.
