Changes:

True 4 layer design (internal gnd and 3.3v)
Smaller LDO
Smaller CAN Tranceiver (TLE7250XLEXUMA1)?
Smaller buck inductor (or at least smaller footprint)
0402 passives where possible
FETs all on one side if possible
4 mounting holes
Smaller encoder IC?
6 mil traces (.16mm), .3mm vias everywhere
